Even if a system you build yourself is only working moderately well:
You have the freedom to change it exactly how you want. Your control over your future is valuable!
Your notes and ideas and software form a part of your digital brain, your digital exoskeleton, the
things that allow you to think reason and do intellectual work are all super important. 

Normally, the issues are:
1) You don't know how to code up your own solution (llms fix this and a makes it easier)
2) Your solution is unstable and you will lose your data (using git by default prvents this)
3) Your information and tools are not portable. They are in someone else's cloud. If they changed their terms of service your cogntiive potential is reduced. Although the strict human brain seperation from tools is hard to define, its definitely something that directly reduces your ability to do work and pull up information effortlessly and that is at the very least a massive loss of time.

A solves these problems.

Everyone loves to own a house over renting it. When you rent something, its not yours, you don't care about its wellbeing or develop it much, and you at some point in the back of your mind always expect to throw it away and not commit to the long term regarding it. If you own it, you build it, develop it, curse at problems that come your way then fix them rather than saying its not my problem.
So why would you rent your brain?
