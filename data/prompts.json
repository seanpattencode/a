  "fix": "Follow these 11 steps: 1) List all files in the project 2) Read README and main entry point 3) Identify the core functionality 4) Run existing tests if any 5) Find code smells, bugs, or inefficiencies 6) Prioritize by impact 7) Fix the highest priority issue 8) Verify the fix works 9) Run tests again 10) Document what you changed 11) Suggest next improvements",
  "bug": "Fix this bug: {task}. Steps: 1) Read relevant files fully 2) Run as user would 3) Ultrathink how most popular apps solve similar problems 4) Read direct docs if applicable 5) Ultrathink best libraries for this 6) Run and debug fix. Guidelines: minimize line count, maximize speed, use direct library calls only, follow readability conventions.",
  "feat": "Add this feature: {task}. Steps: 1) Read relevant files fully 2) Run as user would 3) Ultrathink how most popular apps solve similar problems 4) Ultrathink best libraries for this 5) Run and debug fix. Guidelines: minimize line count, execute as fast as possible, use library glue (all operations handled by library calls, none by custom logic), follow readability conventions.",
  "auto": "Automatic improvement mode. Steps: 1) Read relevant files fully 2) Run project exactly as user would 3) Find what you as user would scream hardest to solve 4) Read how most similar popular apps/programs solve similar problems 5) Simplify user problem until fix almost trivial 6) Rewrite using more or equal direct library calls, fewer or equal lines of custom code, readable code, faster or equal to previous 7) Run as user would and debug.",
  "del": "Deletion mode. Steps: 1) Read relevant files fully 2) Delete any part or process you can - if you don't end up adding back at least 10% you didn't delete enough 2.1) Run project exactly as user would 2.2) Simulate what user screams to restore 2.3) Add back only what user fights hard for, nothing else 2.4) Run new code as user would and fix bugs from deletion 3) Simplify and optimize - do this AFTER step 2, common mistake is optimizing something that should not exist 4) Accelerate cycle time/execution time - every process can be speeded up.",
  "gen": "General guidelines: minimize line count, maximize speed of execution, use direct library calls only, follow readability conventions."
